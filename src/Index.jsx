          VIDEO EDITOR & DIRECTOR
          <br />
          FROM RUSSIA

          EMOTIONS ARE WHAT I AIM TO EVOKE IN PEOPLE THROUGH MY WORK. YOU CANNOT
          EDIT BASED ONLY ON
          <br />
          KNOWLEDGE. AS AN EDITOR IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO FEEL THE RHYTHM OF
          THE SHOT AND THE STORY.
          <br />I SHOULD FEEL A CONNECTION WITH THE HEROES AND THE SCENE.
